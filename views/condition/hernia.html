      <h2 class="heading-xlarge" id="02">What to do about Hernia</h2>
      <p>Your GP will confirm if your lump is a hernia and discuss how it can be treated.</p>

        <p>You’ll need to have an operation to repair your hernia. You may not need one straight away - it depends on the type of hernia and if it’s causing you problems. Your hernia may get bigger if it’s not treated, although this could take months or even years.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-xlarge" id="03">3. Confirming your surgery date</h2>
      <p>After your appointment with the surgeon you’ll get a letter confirming the date of your operation.</p>
      <p>You can change the date but you might have to wait several weeks to get a new one.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-xlarge" id="04">4. Checking your are fit for surgery</h2>
      <p>If you’re having a general anaesthetic, you’ll have an appointment with a nurse at the hospital to make sure you’re healthy enough for surgery. This is called a pre-operative assessment or pre-op.</p>
      <p>If you’re not healthy enough, the operation may be postponed.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-xlarge" id="05">5. Getting ready for surgery</h2>
      <p>The nurse will tell you how to prepare for the operation. You might have to do things like change or stop taking your medicine.</p>
      <p>On the morning of your surgery, you should:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>have a bath or shower</li>
        <li>remove all jewellery, including any piercings </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="callout notice">
        <p>On the morning of the surgery you must not eat after midnight, and not drink after 6am.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="heading-xlarge">6. Day of your surgery</h2>

      <h2 class="heading-xlarge">7. Going home and recovery</h2>
      <p>You can go home when you feel well enough, and can eat and drink. You must be able to walk (if you’re not in a wheelchair), and pee.</p>
      <p>You’ll need someone to help you home by car or taxi and stay with you for at least 24 hours. </p>
