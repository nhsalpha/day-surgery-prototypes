    <h3>Before your operation</h3>
    <p>You may have to wait. This depends on the number of operations before you and any emergencies.</p>
    <p>Your nurse will help you change into a hospital gown and check things like your blood pressure.</p>
    <p>Your anaesthetist will talk you through your anaesthetic.</p>
    <p>Your surgeon will ask you to sign a consent form and mark the place on your body where they’re going to operate.</p>

    <h3>Bringing someone with you</h3>
    <p>Someone can come with you to the ward. While you get ready for surgery and have your operation they can wait in the waiting area or cafeteria.</p>

    <h3>Having your anaesthetic</h3>
    <p>You’ll be taken into the anaesthetic room, where the anaesthetist and their team will put you to sleep.</p>    

    <h3>Your operation</h3>
    <p>The operation will take 90 minutes.</p>    

    <h3>After your Operation</h3>
    <p>When your anaesthetic wears off, you will be looked after by a recovery nurse who will closely monitor you.</p>
    <p>You may feel drowsy, sick, and have some pain - ask the nurse to give you medicine to help.</p> 
    <p>You’ll be moved to another ward where you’ll be monitored until you can go home.</p>

    <div class="callout notice">
        <p>You’ll be going home the same day as your operation. Make sure you’ve arranged for someone to take you home.</p>
    </div>
