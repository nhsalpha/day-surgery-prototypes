          <h2 class="heading-xlarge" id="health-problems-caused-by-type-2-diabetes">Health problems caused by type 2 diabetes</h2>

          <p>You need to watch your health and have regular check-ups if you have type 2 diabetes because it can lead to:</p>

            <li>loss of feeling and pain (nerve damage) - causing problems with sex</li>
            <li>foot problems - sores and infections</li>
            <li>vision loss and blindness</li>

          <h3 id="getting-your-heart-checked">Getting your heart checked</h3>

          <p>You should have your blood fats (cholesterol) and blood pressure checked at least once a year. Diabetes increases your risk of heart disease and stroke so it’s important high blood pressure and high cholesterol is spotted and treated early.</p>

          <h3 id="loss-of-feeling">Loss of feeling</h3>

          <p>You should let your GP or diabetes nurse know if you notice any changes in your body.</p>

          <p>Diabetes can damage your nerves (neuropathy). This can affect any part of your body, causing:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>numbness</li>
            <li>pain or tingling</li>
            <li>problems with sex</li>
            <li>constipation or diarrhoea</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Early treatment can prevent nerve damage getting worse.</p>

          <h3 id="looking-after-your-feet">Looking after your feet</h3>

          <p>You should check your feet every day.</p>

          <p>Diabetes can reduce the blood supply to your feet and cause a loss of feeling.  This means:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>foot injuries don’t heal well</li>
            <li>you may not notice if your foot is sore or injured</li>
          </ul>

          <p>These can lead to ulcers and infections.</p>

          <p>Simple things are important, like:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>keeping feet clean and dry to avoid infection</li>
            <li>trying not to go barefoot outside to avoid niks and cuts</li>
            <li>wearing shoes that fit well</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Speak to your GP or diabetes nurse if you notice any changes in your feet, including:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>cuts, cracks or blisters</li>
            <li>pain or tingling</li>
            <li>numb feet</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Diabetes UK has advice on <a href="https://www.diabetes.org.uk/Guide-to-diabetes/Complications/Feet/">how to check your feet</a></p>

          <p>Your feet should also be checked every year by your GP, diabetes nurse or podiatrist</p>

          <p>Sores or infections that aren’t treated early can lead to gangrene. More than 135 amputations are carried out every week in the UK due to diabetes.</p>

          <h3 id="checking-your-eyes">Checking your eyes</h3>

          <p><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/diabetes/pages/diabetic-eye-screening.aspx">Your eyes should be checked every year</a> for damaged blood vessels, which can cause sight problems <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Diabetic-retinopathy/Pages/Introduction.aspx">(diabetic retinopathy)</a> and blindness.</p>

          <p>Diabetes eye checks can detect damage before it affects your sight. Treating damaged blood vessels early can prevent sight problems.</p>

          <p>Speak to your GP immediately if you notice changes to your sight, including:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>blurred vision, especially at night</li>
            <li>shapes floating in your sight (floaters)</li>
            <li>sensitivity to light</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 id="pregnancy-and-diabetes">Pregnancy and diabetes</h3>

          <p>Speak to your GP or care team if you’re thinking of having a baby.</p>
