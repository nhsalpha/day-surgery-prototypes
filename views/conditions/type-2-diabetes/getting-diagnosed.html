          <h2 class="heading-xlarge" id="getting-diagnosed">Getting diagnosed</h2>

          <p>Type 2 diabetes is often diagnosed following blood or urine tests for something else.</p>

          <p>However, if you have any <a href="check-if-you-have-it">symptoms</a> you should see your GP straight away.</p>

          <p>To find out if you have type 2 diabetes, you usually have to go through the following steps:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Speak to your GP about your symptoms.</li>
            <li>Your GP will check your urine and arrange a blood test to check your blood sugar levels. It usually takes about 1 to 2 days for the results to come back.</li>
            <li>If you have diabetes, your GP will ask you to come in again to explain the test results and what will happen next.</li>
          </ol>         

          <h3 id="if-youre-diagnosed-with-diabetes">If you’re diagnosed with diabetes</h3>

          <p>What your GP will discuss with you during your appointment depends on the diagnosis and the treatment they recommend.</p>

          <p>Generally, they’ll talk to you about:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>what diabetes is</li>
            <li>what high blood sugar means for your health</li>
            <li>what medication you’ll have to take</li>
            <li>your diet and exercise</li>
            <li>your lifestyle, for example alcohol and smoking</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="callout notice" role="note" aria-label="Information">
            <p>Your GP will do their best to discuss the diagnosis with you but this first appointment might only be 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
          </div>

          <h3 id="if-you-have-questions-about-your-diagnosis">If you have questions about your diagnosis</h3>
          <p>It’s usually difficult to take everything in the GP tells you during the appointment.</p>

          <p>Talk to family and friends about what the GP told you and write down all the questions you have.</p>

          <p>Then make another GP appointment and take your list of questions with you.</p>

          <p>There’s also a lot of <a href="finding-help-and-support">information on diabetes</a> available.</p>

          <h3 id="what-happens-after-the-diagnosis">What happens after the diagnosis</h3>
          <p>Usually the following things happen after your diagnosis:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Your GP will prescribe <a href="understanding-medication">medication.</a> It might take time for you to get used to the medication and to find the right amounts for you.</li>
            <li>You might need to make changes to your <a href="food-and-keeping-active">diet and be more active.</a></li>
            <li>You’ll have to go for <a href="going-for-regular-check-ups">regular type 2 diabetes check ups.</a></li>
            <li>You’ll have to look out for certain signs to avoid <a href="health-problems">other health problems.</a></li>
          </ol>
