      <h2>Treating fungal nail infections at home</h2>

      <p>Small fungal nail infections may not need medication.</p>

      <p>You should:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>keep your feet clean and dry</li>
        <li>use separate clippers or scissors to cut your infected nails</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If the look of your nail bothers you or it's painful, speak to your
        pharmacist. They may suggest:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Antifungal nail cream &mdash; it can take up to 12 months to cure
          the infection and doesn't always work</li>
        <li>Nail softening cream &mdash; used for 2 weeks to soften the nail
          so the infection can be scraped off</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The infection is cured when you see healthy nail growing back at the
        base.</p>

      <h2>Treatment from your GP</h2>

      <p>Your GP can prescribe you tablets if your infection is severe or has
        spread to other nails.</p>

      <p>You need to take tablets every day for up to 6 months.</p>

      <p>Tablets can have side effects including:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>headaches</li>
        <li>itching</li>
        <li>loss of taste</li>
        <li>diarrhoea</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Antifungal tablets can also damage your liver. You can't take them if
        you're pregnant or have certain conditions.</p>

      <p>Badly infected nails sometimes need to be removed. It's a small
        operation done under local anaesthetic.</p>

      <h2>Other treatment</h2>

      <p>Laser treatment uses laser to destroy the fungus.</p>

      <p>You’ll have to pay for it as it’s not covered by the NHS. It can be
        expensive. There’s little evidence to show it’s a long-term cure as
        most studies only follow patients for three months.</p>

      <h2>Preventing fungal nail infection</h2>

      <p>Fungal nail infections develop when your feet are constantly warm and damp.
        You’re more likely to get an infection if you wear trainers for a long
        time and have hot, sweaty feet.</p>

      <p>You’re also more likely to get fungal nail infection if you have
        athlete’s foot.</p>

      <p>To prevent fungal nail infection you should:</p>

      <ul>
       <li>keep your feet clean and dry</li>
       <li>wear clean socks every day</li>
       <li>don’t wear shoes that make your feet hot and sweaty</li>
       <li>wear flip flops in showers at the gym, pool etc</li>
       <li>don’t share towels</li>
       <li>throw out old shoes</li>
       <li>don’t wear other people’s shoes</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- CALLOUT! IMPORTANT -->
      <p>Treat athlete’s foot as soon as possible to avoid it spreading to the
         nails.</p>
