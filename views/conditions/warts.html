      <h2>Warts often go away on their own</h2>

      <p>You don’t need to do anything about warts. They’ll usually disappear
        within 2 years.</p>

      <p>Warts don’t cause you any harm. They might itch or bleed but it
        doesn’t mean there’s a problem.</p>

      <p><b><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Genital_warts/Pages/Introduction.aspx">
        Warts on your vulva, penis or anus</a> (genital warts) need treatment.
        Go to a sexual health clinic or speak to your GP for advice.</b></p>

      <h2>You can choose to treat warts</h2>

      <p>You can treat warts if they’re bothering you, they keep coming back or
        they’re painful.</p>

      <h3>Pharmacy treatments</h3>

      <p>You can buy creams, plasters and sprays from pharmacies to remove
        warts.</p>

      <p>However, these treatments take time (up to 3 months), they can
        irritate your skin and don’t always work.</p>

      <p>Don’t use these treatments if you have certain conditions, like
        diabetes, and don’t use them on your face. Ask your pharmacist for
        advice.</p>

      <p>Don’t try to scrape off your warts and verrucas. They might spread.</p>

      <h3>Treatment from your GP</h3>

      <p>Some GPs can freeze warts off (cryotherapy). After treatment, the wart
        swells and should fall off a few weeks later. If the wart is big, it
        may take more than one session. This treatment isn’t available on the
        NHS in all areas.</p>

      <p>If you have a wart on your face, your GP may refer you to a skin
        specialist.</p>

      <h2>How to stop warts spreading</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>wash your hands after touching a wart</li>
        <li>if you have warts on your fingers, don’t suck them or bite your
          nails</li>
        <li>change your socks daily if you have a verruca</li>
        <li>avoid cutting warts when shaving</li>
        <li>don’t share towels</li>
        <li>cover warts with a plaster when swimming</li>
      </ul>
